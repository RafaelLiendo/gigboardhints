# GIGBOARDHINTS

This is a personal project to try to create a fun little page with information about the real geat that inspired the "gear" we can use inside the Headrush units.

I have no affilliation with any of the brands mentioned on the page.

## How to collaborate
There are still many bits an pieces of information missing. If you have any suggestions, i would love to ear from you. There are a couple of ways you can reach out:
- Open an issue on this repo
- Write on the (Gearslutz thread)[https://www.gearslutz.com/board/so-many-guitars-so-little-time/1302068-headrush-gear-presets-original-names.html]
